## Some Anti-SQL voice

- Defining your schema in your ORM is nuts because it ties you to one language, reduces clarity, and sometimes limits SQL features you can use
- Existing migration tools don't pull their weight
- SQL is a more general skill than ORMs and other tools should therefore mirror SQL
- Mirroring live databases to get a schema is insane because are you tunneling to prod to run your linter? Live DB shouldn't be available to developers. Source of truth should be git.
- Schema should be versioned using the same git shas as code so the logic is easy to detect if a deploy requires a migration
